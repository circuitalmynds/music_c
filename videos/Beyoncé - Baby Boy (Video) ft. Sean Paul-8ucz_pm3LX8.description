Lyrics:

Baby boy, you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
Baby boy, not a day goes by
Without my fantasies
I think about you all the time
I see you in my dreams
Aah, oh my baby's fly, baby oh
Yes no hurt me so good, baby oh
I'm so wrapped up in your love let me go
Let me breathe, stay out my fantasies
